Dictionaries
------------
Free dictionaries are available at [http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary](http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/dictionary). They simply need to be dropped into this folder. The folder name MUST be the exact same as the dictionary and affix files (minus the extensions ".dic" and ".aff", of course).
